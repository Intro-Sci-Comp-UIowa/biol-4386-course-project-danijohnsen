# The Dogs of _Tsenacomoco_: Jamestown Phylogeny Reconstruction


The goal of this project is to reconstruct Figure 2 from the unpublished manuscript of the relationship between ancient DNA and indigenous dogs at the Jamestown Colony. This phylogenetic tree illustrates the situation of Jamestown dogs in the 17th century among the indigenous dog population; a phylogenetic tree of the dogs indigenous to the Americas and those found in the Jamestown Colony.

## Introduction
Due to the colnization of the Americas during and after Columbus' infiltration, like many things, there followed a drastic change in the preexisting environment. Specifically, this research interrogates the replacement of indigenous North American dogs with European dogs genetically between this initial contact and modern day.

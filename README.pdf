# The Dogs of _Tsenacomoco_: Jamestown Phylogeny Reconstruction


The goal of this project is to reconstruct Figure 2 from the unpublished manuscript of the relationship between ancient DNA and indigenous dogs at the Jamestown Colony. This phylogenetic tree illustrates the situation of Jamestown dogs in the 17th century among the indigenous dog population; a phylogenetic tree of the dogs indigenous to the Americas and those found in the Jamestown Colony.

## Introduction
Due to the colonization of the Americas during and after Columbus' infiltration, like many things, there followed a drastic change in the preexisting environment. Specifically, this research interrogates the replacement of indigenous North American dogs with European dogs genetically between this initial contact and modern day. Because of a messy history with the specific utility of dogs in relation to human civilization, it is difficult to determine where the lineages overlap from just archeological evidence or historical record. Specifically, it is in question whether the dogs owned by the colonists at Jamestown were wholly European, Indigenous, or mixed. In order to gather data, Thomas and others collected and sequenced ancient mitochondrial DNA from 3 different archaeological dogs from between 1609 and 1617 AD, and found that the dogs from the Jamestown Colony had maternal ties to North American dogs. This creates a complexity of inquiry into social history and usages of dogs in colonialist environments. I chose this project as I don't have copious experience with coding or data to reproduce something wholly original without help or error.

## Methods
-Raw reads run through PALEOMIX (ancient DNA pipeline). PALEOMIX pipelines help to rapidly process HTS data (multiple genetic alignments, in this case).

-Multiple Sequence Alignment using MUSCLE (140 sequences)

-Maximum Likelihood Tree RaxML (may try RAxML-ng 

-**Bayesian Phylogenetic Tree using BEAST v1. 10**:
--Using a fixed mutation rate 1.0 x 10^-7 subsitutions/site/year
--Using a constant demographic model
--Using an HKY subsitution model with gamma distribution
